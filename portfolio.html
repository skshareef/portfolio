								<p>
									This project presents a solution to the challenging task of evaluating the quality
									of
									skull stripped brain MRI images. In the field of neuroimaging research, such images
									are
									frequently shared in open access data repositories. However, ensuring the accuracy
									and
									reliability of the segmentation results is a time-consuming process. To address this
									issue, the authors propose a deep neural network algorithm based on 3D Convolutional
									Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging the power of CNNs and their ability to analyze
									3D
									medical data, the algorithm automates the inspection of skull stripped MRI images
									and
									aims to improve the overall accuracy of the segmentation process. </p>

								<p>
									The Stock Data Analysis and Dashboard Project was a comprehensive undertaking aimed
									at
									evaluating the performance of Test Stock over recent months. Utilizing Python, I
									skillfully scraped relevant financial data from a reputable source, including daily
									close prices, high and low prices, traded volume, and open-close changes for each
									trading day. The collected data underwent thorough analysis, and I computed
									essential
									metrics like the highest price, lowest price, and average closing price for the past
									3
									months. Building on this analysis, I harnessed the power of Pandas, Dash, and Plotly
									to
									craft an interactive dashboard that effectively conveyed the stock's behavior. The
									dashboard featured four visually engaging graphs displaying the daily close price,
									daily
									high and low prices in a candlestick chart, traded volume in a bar chart, and the
									open-close change in another bar chart for a specific date. Additionally, I
									implemented
									a filter functionality to enable users to explore the stock's performance over
									customizable time durations. The project showcased my strong data analysis skills,
									web
									scraping expertise, and ability to deliver user-friendly data visualizations that
									empower stakeholders to make informed financial decisions. </p>
